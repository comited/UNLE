Rotary Viper's ideas:
Keep collision detection code from earlier. Just make it move slower


Have a base shape for the nodes

If a node is dragged, check how many node are connected to it.
Pull nodes with it in the same direction, just at a slower speed.

Important part below:
If a node is released:
1. Calculate the center point for all connected nodes
2. All nodes will travel to this center point until all nodes are close enough to the center point
