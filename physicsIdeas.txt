Rotary Viper's ideas:
Keep collision detection code from earlier. Just make it move slower


Have a base shape for the nodes

If a node is dragged, check how many node are connected to it.
Pull nodes with it in the same direction, just at a slower speed.

Important part below:
If a node is released:
1. Calculate the center point for all connected nodes
2. All nodes will travel to this center point until all nodes are close enough to the center point

Lochyj's ideas:

when a node is clicked it should be 100% locked into the position of the cursor

the edges coming off of the nodes should be evenly spaced e.g: if there are 4 edges to a node then
